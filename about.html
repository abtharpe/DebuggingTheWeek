    <main class="about-content">
        <p>Hi, I'm Brock -- a dad, future professional software developer, writer (I guess I am now ðŸ˜…), and lifelong learner who enjoys exploring the intersections of code and life. This blog is my space to reflect, debug thoughts, and share what I'm learning -- both professionally and personally.</p>

        <p>I'm currently working on my bachelor's degree through Arizona State University (Go Sun Devils!) and managing full-time responsibilities as both a dad and a logistics manager for a liquor distribution company in South Africa.</p>

        <p>When I'm not coding or writing, you'll find me spending time with my family, reading a good sci-fi opera, or playing a round of golf with friends.</p>

        <p>Thanks for stopping by -- feel free to check out the <a href="blog.html">blog posts</a> or head back to the <a href="index.html">homepage</a>.</p>
