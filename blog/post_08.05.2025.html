        <h1>The looming AI replacement</h1>
        <p><em>Posted on August 13, 2025</em></p><br>

        <p>AI is here, and the writing on the wall couldn’t be clearer: it’s here to stay. On one hand, it’s been an incredibly useful addition to my life — a powerful tool that has improved how I learn, work, and explore ideas. But on the other, it has introduced a wave of anticipatory anxiety.</p>

        <br><p>As someone completing a computer science degree and navigating a career transition into software development, I find myself caught between excitement and apprehension. AI is constantly presented — almost forcefully — as the inevitable replacement for entry-level developers. It’s hard to ignore the growing narrative that junior roles may soon become obsolete or, at best, severely limited.</p>

        <br><p>There’s already been a great deal of thoughtful discussion on this topic, and I’ve found myself drawn to voices that cut through the hype. In particular, I’ve appreciated the conversations on <em>Hard Fork</em>, <em>Soft Skills Engineering</em>, and <em>Practical AI</em> — podcasts hosted by people who clearly have their fingers on the pulse of the industry. They don’t offer panic or blind optimism, but instead provide nuanced, grounded takes on the rapid rise of AI and what it means for those entering the field.</p>

        <br><p>For me, these podcasts have been a rare source of reassurance. They acknowledge both the opportunities and the real concerns. A common thread among them is that we’re still in the early stages of this technological shift — the "wild west" era of AI — where nothing is fully settled and no one has all the answers. That uncertainty, while scary, also means there's room to adapt, to grow, and to find new niches that AI can't easily replace.</p>

        <br><p>So, am I scared? Absolutely. But left without a way forward? Not a chance.</p>

        <br><p>The biggest takeaway I’ve gathered from listening to these industry professionals is that adaptation is the key. I truly believe there’s still a place for me in all of this — as long as I approach it with the right mindset and a genuine willingness to learn. The entry-level landscape isn’t going to vanish overnight; it’s just going to change shape. Accepting that shift early, and pivoting with purpose, is the smartest move I can make right now.</p>

        <br><p>That’s why I’m turning my focus toward learning and integrating these new AI tools. But I know that doing so requires balance. As a junior developer, there’s a real risk of becoming overly reliant — letting AI become a crutch instead of a compass. My goal is to use these tools to assist and guide me, not to do the work for me.</p>

        <br><p>That means asking better questions, letting the tools help me explore solutions, and then pushing myself to understand the <em>why</em> behind the answers. Growth doesn’t come from shortcuts — it comes from struggle, curiosity, and persistence. If I can maintain that mindset, I think there’s still plenty of space for junior developers like me to not only survive this shift, but thrive within it.</p>

        <br><p>For now, I’ll do my best to table the anxiety. Instead, I’ll embrace the opportunity to learn a new technology and keep pushing forward. There’s no sense in slowing down or accepting defeat. After all, while AI may have its own toolset, I have mine too — and one of the most valuable tools I bring to the table is perseverance.</p>
